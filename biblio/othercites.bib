	abstract = {This article describes a complete theory of spatial coherence for undulator radiation sources. Current estimations of coherence properties often assume that undulator sources are quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely on the application of the van Cittert–Zernike theorem for calculating the degree of transverse coherence. Such assumption is not adequate when treating third generation light sources, because the vertical (geometrical) emittance of the electron beam is comparable or even much smaller than the radiation wavelength in a very wide spectral interval that spans over four orders of magnitude (from 0.1 up to 103Å). Sometimes, the so-called Gaussian–Schell model, that is widely used in statistical optics in the description of partially coherent sources, is applied as an alternative to the quasi-homogeneous model. However, as we will demonstrate, this model fails to properly describe coherent properties of X-ray beams from non-homogeneous undulator sources. As a result, a more rigorous analysis is required. We propose a technique, based on statistical optics and Fourier optics, to explicitly calculate the cross-spectral density of an undulator source in the most general case, at any position after the undulator. Our theory, that makes consistent use of dimensionless analysis, allows relatively easy treatment and physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space, together with their region of applicability. Particular emphasis is given to the asymptotic situation when the horizontal emittance is much larger than the radiation wavelength, and the vertical emittance is arbitrary. This case is practically relevant for third generation synchrotron radiation sources.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we couple synchrotron radiation (SR) theory with a branch of physical optics, namely laser beam optics. We show that the theory of laser beams is successful in characterizing radiation fields associated with any SR source. Both radiation beam generated by an ultra-relativistic electron in a magnetic device and laser beam are solutions of the wave equation based on paraxial approximation. It follows that they are similar in all aspects. In the space–frequency domain SR beams appear as laser beams whose transverse extents are large compared with the wavelength. In practical situations (e.g. undulator, bending magnet sources), radiation beams exhibit a virtual “waist” where the wavefront is often plane. Remarkably, the field distribution of a SR beam across the waist turns out to be strictly related with the inverse Fourier transform of the far-field angle distribution. Then, we take advantage of standard Fourier Optics techniques and apply the Fresnel propagation formula to characterize the SR beam. Altogether, we show that it is possible to reconstruct the near-field distribution of the SR beam outside the magnetic setup from the knowledge of the far-field pattern. The general theory of SR in the near-zone developed in this paper is illustrated for the special cases of undulator radiation. Using known analytical formulas for the far-field pattern and its inverse Fourier transform we find analytical expressions for near-field distributions in terms of far-field distributions.},

	url = {https://bib-pubdb1.desy.de/record/275967},
	abstract = {The emergence of Free Electron Lasers (FEL) as a fourth generation of light sources is a breakthrough. FELs operating in the X-ray range (XFEL) allow one to carry out completely new experiments that probably most of the natural sciences would benefit. Self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) is the baseline FEL operation mode: the radiation pulse starts as a spontaneous emission from the electron bunch and is being amplified during an FEL process until it reaches saturation. The SASE FEL radiation usually has poor properties in terms of a spectral bandwidth or, on the other side, longitudinal coherence. Self-seeding is a promising approach to narrow the SASE bandwidth of XFELs significantly in order to produce nearly transform-limited pulses. It is achieved by the radiation pulse monochromatization in the middle of an FEL amplification process. Following the successful demonstration of the self-seeding setup in the hard X-ray range at the LCLS, there is a need for a self-seeding extension into the soft X-ray range.Here a numerical method to simulate the soft X-ray self seeding (SXRSS) monochromator performance is presented. It allows one to perform start-to-end self-seeded FEL simulations along with (in our case) GENESIS simulation code. Based on this method, the performance of the LCLS self-seeded operation was simulated showing a good agreement with an experiment. Also the SXRSS monochromator design developed in SLAC was adapted for the SASE3 type undulator beamline at the European XFEL.The optical system was studied using Gaussian beam optics, wave optics propagation method and ray tracing to evaluate the performance of the monochromator itself. Wave optics analysis takes into account the actual beam wavefront of the radiation from the coherent FEL source, third order aberrations and height errors from each optical element.The monochromator design is based on a toroidal VLS grating working at a fixed incidence angle mounting without both entrance and exit slits. It is optimized for the spectral range of \$300-1200\${\textasciitilde}eV providing resolving power above \$ 7000 \$. The proposed monochromator is composed of three mirrors and the grating. Start-to-end simulation as a case study of the self-seeded European XFEL performance with a proposed SXRSS monochromator is presented. It shows that the laser pulse power reaches a TW-level with its spectral density about eighty times higher than that of the conventional SASE pulse at saturation. Serkez, Svitozar},

In addition to the SR from one electron, incoherent and coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) emitted by electron bunches is treated. CPU-efficient CSR calculation method taking into account 6D phase space distribution of electrons in a bunch is proposed. The properties of CSR emitted by electron bunches with small longitudinal and large transverse size are studied numerically (such situation can be realized in storage rings e.g. by transverse deflection of the electron bunches in special RF cavities). It is shown that if the transverse size of a bunch is much larger than the diffraction limit for single-electron SR at a given wavelength – it affects the angular distribution of the CSR at this wavelength and reduces the coherent flux. Nevertheless, for transverse bunch dimensions up to several millimeters and the longitudinal bunch size smaller than hundred micrometers, the resulting CSR flux in the far infrared spectral range is still many orders of magnitude higher than the flux of incoherent SR.},

	abstract = {We consider the maximum of the Wigner distribution (WD) of synchrotron radiation (SR) fields as a possible definition of SR source brightness. Such figure of merit was originally introduced in the SR community by Kim. The brightness defined in this way is always positive and, in the geometrical optics limit, can be interpreted as maximum density of photon flux in phase space. For undulator and bending magnet radiation from a single electron, the WD function can be explicitly calculated. In the case of an electron beam with a finite emittance the brightness is given by the maximum of the convolution of a single electron WD function and the probability distribution of the electrons in phase space. In the particular case when both electron beam size and electron beam divergence dominate over the diffraction size and the diffraction angle, one can use a geometrical optics approach. However, there are intermediate regimes when only the electron beam size or the electron beam divergence dominate. In this asymptotic cases the geometrical optics approach is still applicable, and the brightness definition used here yields back once more the maximum photon flux density in phase space. In these intermediate regimes we find a significant numerical disagreement between exact calculations and the approximation for undulator brightness currently used in literature. We extend the WD formalism to a satisfactory theory for the brightness of a bending magnet. We find that in the intermediate regimes the usually accepted approximation for bending magnet brightness turns out to be inconsistent even parametrically.},
