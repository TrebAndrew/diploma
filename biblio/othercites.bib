	abstract = {This article describes a complete theory of spatial coherence for undulator radiation sources. Current estimations of coherence properties often assume that undulator sources are quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely on the application of the van Cittert–Zernike theorem for calculating the degree of transverse coherence. Such assumption is not adequate when treating third generation light sources, because the vertical (geometrical) emittance of the electron beam is comparable or even much smaller than the radiation wavelength in a very wide spectral interval that spans over four orders of magnitude (from 0.1 up to 103Å). Sometimes, the so-called Gaussian–Schell model, that is widely used in statistical optics in the description of partially coherent sources, is applied as an alternative to the quasi-homogeneous model. However, as we will demonstrate, this model fails to properly describe coherent properties of X-ray beams from non-homogeneous undulator sources. As a result, a more rigorous analysis is required. We propose a technique, based on statistical optics and Fourier optics, to explicitly calculate the cross-spectral density of an undulator source in the most general case, at any position after the undulator. Our theory, that makes consistent use of dimensionless analysis, allows relatively easy treatment and physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space, together with their region of applicability. Particular emphasis is given to the asymptotic situation when the horizontal emittance is much larger than the radiation wavelength, and the vertical emittance is arbitrary. This case is practically relevant for third generation synchrotron radiation sources.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we couple synchrotron radiation ({SR}) theory with a branch of physical optics, namely laser beam optics. We show that the theory of laser beams is successful in characterizing radiation fields associated with any {SR} source. Both radiation beam generated by an ultra-relativistic electron in a magnetic device and laser beam are solutions of the wave equation based on paraxial approximation. It follows that they are similar in all aspects. In the space–frequency domain {SR} beams appear as laser beams whose transverse extents are large compared with the wavelength. In practical situations (e.g. undulator, bending magnet sources), radiation beams exhibit a virtual “waist” where the wavefront is often plane. Remarkably, the field distribution of a {SR} beam across the waist turns out to be strictly related with the inverse Fourier transform of the far-field angle distribution. Then, we take advantage of standard Fourier Optics techniques and apply the Fresnel propagation formula to characterize the {SR} beam. Altogether, we show that it is possible to reconstruct the near-field distribution of the {SR} beam outside the magnetic setup from the knowledge of the far-field pattern. The general theory of {SR} in the near-zone developed in this paper is illustrated for the special cases of undulator radiation. Using known analytical formulas for the far-field pattern and its inverse Fourier transform we find analytical expressions for near-field distributions in terms of far-field distributions.},

	url = {https://bib-pubdb1.desy.de/record/275967},
	abstract = {The emergence of Free Electron Lasers ({FEL}) as a fourth generation of light sources is a breakthrough. {FELs} operating in the X-ray range ({XFEL}) allow one to carry out completely new experiments that probably most of the natural sciences would benefit. Self-amplified spontaneous emission ({SASE}) is the baseline {FEL} operation mode: the radiation pulse starts as a spontaneous emission from the electron bunch and is being amplified during an {FEL} process until it reaches saturation. The {SASE} {FEL} radiation usually has poor properties in terms of a spectral bandwidth or, on the other side, longitudinal coherence. Self-seeding is a promising approach to narrow the {SASE} bandwidth of {XFELs} significantly in order to produce nearly transform-limited pulses. It is achieved by the radiation pulse monochromatization in the middle of an {FEL} amplification process. Following the successful demonstration of the self-seeding setup in the hard X-ray range at the {LCLS}, there is a need for a self-seeding extension into the soft X-ray range.Here a numerical method to simulate the soft X-ray self seeding ({SXRSS}) monochromator performance is presented. It allows one to perform start-to-end self-seeded {FEL} simulations along with (in our case) {GENESIS} simulation code. Based on this method, the performance of the {LCLS} self-seeded operation was simulated showing a good agreement with an experiment. Also the {SXRSS} monochromator design developed in {SLAC} was adapted for the {SASE}3 type undulator beamline at the European {XFEL}.The optical system was studied using Gaussian beam optics, wave optics propagation method and ray tracing to evaluate the performance of the monochromator itself. Wave optics analysis takes into account the actual beam wavefront of the radiation from the coherent {FEL} source, third order aberrations and height errors from each optical element.The monochromator design is based on a toroidal {VLS} grating working at a fixed incidence angle mounting without both entrance and exit slits. It is optimized for the spectral range of \$300-1200\${\textasciitilde}{eV} providing resolving power above \$ 7000 \$. The proposed monochromator is composed of three mirrors and the grating. Start-to-end simulation as a case study of the self-seeded European {XFEL} performance with a proposed {SXRSS} monochromator is presented. It shows that the laser pulse power reaches a {TW}-level with its spectral density about eighty times higher than that of the conventional {SASE} pulse at saturation. Serkez, Svitozar},
